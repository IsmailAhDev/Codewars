/*  THE PROBLEM 


Terminal game bug squashing
You are creating a text-based terminal version of your favorite board game. In the board game, each turn has six steps that must happen in this order: roll the dice, move, combat, get coins, buy more health, and print status.

You are using a library that already has the functions below. Create a function named main that calls the functions in the proper order.

- combat
- buyHealth
- getCoins
- printStatus
- rollDice
- move
